## Projects

- ### [Exploring fractal sets](https://github.com/gabriel-msilva/fractal-sets)

Code for generating Mendelbrot and Julia sets images and animations. This will turned into a more Math-detailed post at my blog.

  _Themes: Fractals, Parallel processing, Data visualization_

  _Programming languages: Python_

- ### [COVID-19 data visualizations](https://gabriel-msilva.github.io/covid-19/) (english and portuguese versions)

A set of data visualizations exploring the repository data of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases published by Johns Hopkins University Center.

  _Themes: Data visualization, Storytelling_

  _Programming languages: R_

- ### [Class about NLP](https://github.com/gabriel-msilva/bible) (portuguese)

A simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis using Bible texts (no copyright issues) created for a class at work. Also includes data processing from XLM files.
